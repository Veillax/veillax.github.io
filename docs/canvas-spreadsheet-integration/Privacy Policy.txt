Privacy Policy
1. Information We Collect
We collect user information, including but not limited to email addresses and Canvas LMS REST API tokens, to provide and improve the service.

2. How We Use Your Information
User information is used for:
A). User Authentication: User emails are retrieved only for User Authentication, allowing for a User Blacklist to be issued in case the service is misused.
B). Updates Mailing List: User emails may be stored only if the user requests to join the Update Mailing List, an email mailing list used to inform users when a system update is issued
C). Functionality: Canvas LMS REST API Access Tokens are never stored in our system.

3. Sharing of Information
We do not share user information with third parties unless required by law.

4. Cookies
Cookies are not used.

5. Security
The system does not store user information, so security is not a system concern, but a User concern. If the User shares the Client Project (the client side project that is used to run the system), the User can reset the Access Token in Canvas.

6. Third-Party Links
The service may contain links to third-party websites. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites.

7. Changes to Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to update or modify our privacy policy. Users will be notified of any changes.
